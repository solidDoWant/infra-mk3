  # ****************************** IMPORTANT *******************************
  # * This dataset has sync writes disabled. This reduces the I/O overhead *
  # * of writes, but increases the risk of data loss. ZFS will sync data   *
  # * to disk at least every zfs_txg_timeout (1) seconds. However, more    *
  # * data can be lost. Fluent Bit aggregates events in "chunks", so the   *
  # * actual data loss is equal to the time from the first event is        *
  # * generated upstream, to when the last event in a chunk is processed + *
  # * zfs_txg_timeout.                                                     *
