# This doesn't currently do anything. Vhosts cannot be edited, so I cannot reconfigure
# the default vhost. Kyoo does not yet support specifying a non-default vhost. See
# https://github.com/zoriya/Kyoo/issues/537.
# Once this is supported, I will add a vhost that sets the default queue type to "quorum".
# This will remove the need to managing queues declaratively before the application is
# deployed, reducing the coupling between the backend and the application.
# The operator does not currently support managing this. I'll need to file a PR for this
# functionality at a later date.
