# 2.5" drive drawer

This is a plastic 2.5" 8x drive drawer. This is designed specifically for 8x 2.5" drive bays in Dell PowerEdge 12th and 13th generation servers. It is essentially a box with a sliding lid, that drive caddies can mount to. This trades some data storage for physical storage in chassis with matching drive bays. This serves as a replacement for the [caddy spacers](../Caddy%20spacers/), in that it allows for installing empty caddies inside a server.

## Manufacturing information

These are designed to be 3D printed with PLA. On my [Bambu Labs X1C printer](https://bambulab.com/en/x1) these take about 4.5 hours each to print, and cost around $2.60 in plastic. I used 15% infill, and would not reduce this further.

## Materials
* About 130g of PLA
* 8x drive caddy
* 32x M3 x 4mm screws

## Tools
* 1x 3D printer
* 1x M3 tap (optional)
* 1x screwdriver

## Assembly steps

1. Print the drawer and lid.
2. Tap the holes with an M3 tap (optional). I found that the plastic was soft enough to just screw into directly, but the holes are the correct drill size for a M3 tap.
3. For each caddy:
   1. Insert the drawer assembly into the caddy. The "U" shaped side with vents should face outwards, with the other vented side facing towards the front of the caddy.
   2. Use four M3 x 4mm screws to join the two parts.
4. Slide the lid into the side of the drawer.
5. Insert the assembly into a server.
