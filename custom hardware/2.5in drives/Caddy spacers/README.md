# 2.5" drive caddy spacers/blanks

This is a plastic 2.5" drive "blank", for use _inside_ an existing drive caddy. Most 2.5" drive caddies/trays look like this:

The problem with this design is that when there is no drive installed, the retaining mechanism (black  tab at the bottom) doesn't keep the tray in a server. Instead, the whole assembly just kind of folds. These blanks are designed to be the exact size and shape of a typical 2.5" drive, so that they can be installed inside a drive caddy/tray to ensure the latching mechanism works without an actual drive. This has the added benefit of keeping track of the drive screws, as they are used to install the blank.

## Manufacturing information

These are designed to be 3D printed with PLA. On my [Bambu Labs X1C printer](https://bambulab.com/en/x1) these take about 20 minutes each to print, and cost around $0.20 in plastic each. I used 15% infill but this is probably overkill.

## Materials
* About 10g of PLA
* 1x drive caddy
* 4x M3 x 4mm screws

## Tools
* 1x 3D printer
* 1x M3 tap (optional)
* 1x screwdriver

## Assembly steps

1. Print the blank(s).
2. Tap the holes with an M3 tap (optional). I found that the plastic was soft enough to just screw into directly, but the holes are the correct drill size for a M3 tap.
3. Insert the blank into a drive tray/caddy. The side with the gap should face outwards, and the flat side should be flush with the bottom.
4. Use four M3 x 4mm screws to join the two parts.
5. Insert the assembly into a server.
